Most existing works on neural architecture search aim at finding architectures that optimize for prediction accuracy. These methods may generate complex architectures consuming excessively high energy consumption, which is not suitable for computing environment
with limited power budgets. We propose MONAS, a Multi-Objective Neural Architecture
Search with novel reward functions that consider both prediction accuracy and power consumption when exploring neural architectures. MONAS effectively explores the design
space and searches for architectures satisfying the given requirements. The experimental
results demonstrate that the architectures found by MONAS achieve accuracy comparable
to or better than the state-of-the-art models, while having better energy efficiency.
