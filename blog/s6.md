Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has successfully identified neural network architectures that exceed human designed ones on large-scale image classification. In
this paper, we study NAS for semantic image segmentation.
Existing works often focus on searching the repeatable cell
structure, while hand-designing the outer network structure
that controls the spatial resolution changes. This choice
simplifies the search space, but becomes increasingly problematic for dense image prediction which exhibits a lot more
network level architectural variations. Therefore, we propose to search the network level structure in addition to the
cell level structure, which forms a hierarchical architecture
search space. We present a network level search space that
includes many popular designs, and develop a formulation
that allows efficient gradient-based architecture search (3
P100 GPU days on Cityscapes images). We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method on the challenging Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012, and ADE20K datasets.
Auto-DeepLab, our architecture searched specifically for
semantic image segmentation, attains state-of-the-art performance without any ImageNet pretraining.1
